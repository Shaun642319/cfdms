# Campus Food Delivery Management System (CFDMS)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **menu-driven console application** built in C to simulate a **Campus Food Delivery Management System (CFDMS)**.
It supports four roles:

* **Students**: Place orders, top-up balance, view order history, update profile.
* **Restaurants**: Manage menus, view/process orders, assign delivery drivers, generate sales reports.
* **Delivery Personnel**: View assigned orders, update delivery status.
* **Admin**: Manage system reports (students, restaurants, deliveries, sales, performance).

All data is stored in **CSV-like `.txt` files** under the `data/` directory.
